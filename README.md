## Documentation
Coming soon.
 
## State
In its present state, the interpretor should execute most properly-written code without complaint (with a few not-yet-implemented exceptions). Some malformed operations will be missed by the parser and interpreter and will result in a crash or in erratic behavior. This is being worked on before moving on to support for functions and custom types. 
 
## Nala IDE 
Nala is being developed alongside the [Nala IDE](https://github.com/ntwiles/Nala-IDE).
