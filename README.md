# Nala Programming Language
 
Nala is an programming language designed for use in easily developing console applications. This repository includes a lexer, parser, and interpreter written in C#.
 
In its present state, the interpretor should execute most properly-written code without complaint (with a few not-yet-implemented exceptions). Some malformed operations will be missed by the parser and interpreter and will result in a crash or in erratic behavior. This is being worked on before moving on to support for functions and custom types. 

## Features
- [x] Basic console i/o.
- [x] Arithmetic and relational operations.
- [x] While loops.
- [x] Single-dimensional arrays.
- [x] Scope
- [ ] Functions
